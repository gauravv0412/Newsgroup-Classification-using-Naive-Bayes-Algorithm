# Newsgroups-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm

This project aims to classify different News articles among 20 different News-Groups using my own implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm.

It has achieved 76% accuracy on testing data and 83% accuracy on Training data.

The dataset consists of 20,000 news articles- 1000 from each category.

Results are compared with inbuilt Naive Bayes algorithm in Keras and shown in notebook. And it shows they are very similar to my implementation.
